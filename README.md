Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is all about writing instructions called code for computers enabling the building of Apps, Games, Websites and Websystems that solve real world problems using technology.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Machine code
2. Assembly language
3. Higher Programming languages
4. Cloud computing
5. Artificial Intelligence

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Development/Coding
5. Testing and Bug Fixing
6. Deployment
7. Maintenance

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology has a linear flow- one step finishes befiore the next steps while Agile is a more flexible methodology which focuses on small rapid cycles  called code sprints.
Scenarios
1. Waterfall methodology is ideal in predictable, strictly compliant, structured and high risk projects.
2. Agile methodology is used in dynamic, flexible and user-driven applocations  

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer
1. Writing code
2. Testing software applications
3. Software maintenance
   
Quality Assurance Engineer
1. Ensuring software quality standards are met
2. Development of software test cases

Project Manager
1.Overseeing the project implementation over the entire Software Development Life Cycle 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provides code writing and editing, Debugging, Code Compilation and Execution.
Examples
VS Code, Netbeans
VCS tracks and ensures that software is up to date and inline with the provisions of its life cycle development
Examples
Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Users' unclearly defining software development requirements for their platforms.
How to overcome: The uswers should clearly define the software requirements before execution of the softwares development life cycle.
2. Keeping up with rapid technological changes.
How to overcome: Being actively involved in codecamps, Tech Webinars, Hackathons and any other platforms proving current technological updates. 
3. Managing code complexity.
How to overcome: Using applropriate tools amd working closely with the entire project development team.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing 
It is done at the modular level of a software application (a single module).
Integration Testing
It is done after different software modules have been merged together to form the entire softwatre application (multiple modules).
Stystem Testing
It is performed at the point whereby the entire software system has been fully developed and ready for deployment (the whole set of modules).
Acceptance Testing ) 
It is performed at the point of deploymemt with the inclusion of the client/user 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the process of providing inputs to AI models. 

Importance of Prompt Engineering
1. Optimization of AI models' response and improvement of its base model
   

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me about Kenya.
Tell me about Kenya's struggle for independence and developments after independence.

Why the improved prompt is more effective
The inclusion of "Kenya's struggle for independence and developments after independence" makes the prompt clear, specific and concise.
